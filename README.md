HELLO EVERYONE!! WELCOME BACK. TODAY I AM GOING TO MAKE MAGGI WHICH IS POPULARLY CALLED "TWO MINUTES NOODLES".
SO MY RECIPE IS VERY SIMPLE AND IT WILL DELIVER A TASTY AND MOUTHWATERTING MAGGI TO YOUR PLATE.
WE NEED TO HAVE A MAGGI AND 250ml WATER. JUST GET A PAN, I HAVE A ONE VERY SIMILAR TO PUBG ONE...ALRIGHT POUR THE WATER IN THE PAN AND LET SOME BOIL COME TO WATER AND AS SOON AS YOU HEAR  A HISSING SOUND CUT THE MAGGI PACKET AND BREAK THE NOODLE CAKE INTO FOUR PARTS AND PUT IN THAT WATER. AFTER THAT ADD THE TASTEMAKER AND SOME SALT. ALSO IF YOU LIKE VERY SPICY FOOD THEN FETCH CHILLI SAUCE AND PUT IN THE MAGGI . EVEN YOU CAN ADD AN EXTRA MAGGI MASALA WHICH WILL HELP YOU TO MAKE MAGGI MORE SPICY AND MORE TASTY.
AFTER THAT ENJOY YOUR MAGGI...ITS DONE!!!!! NOW WATCH TELEVISION AND ENJOY YOUR MAGGI WITH SOE COLD DRINKS....
