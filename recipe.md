TO MAKE A MAGGI I MEAN A DELICIOUS AND MOUTHWATERING MAGGI FOLLOW THE FOLLOWING STEPS:
1. BRING A MAGGI PACKET, EXTRA MAGGI MASALA
2. GET 250 ML WATER AND POUR IT IN A PAN.
3. CUT THE MAGGI PACKET AND BREAK THE NOODLE CAKE INTO FOUR PARTS
4. AS SOON AS YOU SEE THE WATER IS BOILING AND YOU HEAR A HISSING SOUND THEN PUT THE NOODLES INTO THE WATER.
5. AFTER THAT ADD TASTEMAKER AND ALSO MAGGI MASALA((TO MAKE MORE DELICIOUS)). IF YOU WANT YOU CAN ALSO ADD CHILLI SAUCE(TO MAKE SPICY).
6. STIR IT FOR SOMETIME.
7. AFTER THAT EMJOY IT ... YOUR DELICIOUS MAGGI IS READY...YEYY..
